        Installation is the current &quot;inoutside&quot; installation in the 
        series of video tracking installations for public spaces. One perceives 
        a virtual sculpture space-envelope come into being and vanish.This everchanging 
        sculpture is controlled by the occurrences on Grabbeplatz, D&uuml;sseldorf). 
        Like a naturally grown architecture this form is embedded into the contours 
        of the immediate environment of the current location of the viewer.The 
        positions of the people on Grabbeplatz as well as the position of the 
        viewer of the picture are marked with red crosses. Connecting lines point 
        from marked people approximately onto the place of the space-envelope 
        where the people influence the generated form.<br>
        The installation is made up of nightly projections onto the fountain wall 
        in the passageway of K20. On the roof of the art collection two infrared 
        emitters and an infrared camera are installed.The emitters make up for 
        the missing daylight, so that the camera may pick up the motions on the 
        site. The regular light is an important prerequisite to be able to deduct 
        the motions of the people.This is done by a video tracking program. It 
        is determined where on the site movement takes place by comparing the 
        current video image with a previously taken image of the empty site.The 
        results are then sorted by &quot;blobs&quot;;&quot;Blob&quot; signifies 
        a &quot;Binary Large Object&quot; and denotes a field of non-structured 
        coordinates which moves equably.These animated data-fields are passed 
        on to a graphic- and sound program that calculates the virtual sculpture 
        from the abstracted traces. In this the motion traces<br>
        are interpreted. As in earlier installations such as &quot;memory of space&quot;(2002),&quot;trace 
        pattern&quot; (1998) or &quot;inoutside I&quot; (1998) and &quot;inoutside 
        II&quot; (1999), the supplied video image is visible on the basis of a 
        video texture so that the people who see this image may recognize themselves 
        in the virtual image. So it becomes clear how the virtual forms, the<br>
        clouds and arrows are calculated.<br>
        The installation deals with architectural and city-planning concepts.A 
        new, different design technique should be attempted, that is aimed at 
        observing the behaviour of peopl towards architecture.The goal is to depict 
        the city or architecture as a dynamic organism. To show city and people 
        as something collective, something in constant transformation, is what 
        the installation wishes to convey. The shape of the sculpture results 
        from a Kohonen-Net, a neural network representing the statistics of space 
        usage.
