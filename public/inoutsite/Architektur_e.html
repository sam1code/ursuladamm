        public competition to design underground stations for the &quot;Wehrhahn&#148; 
        train line in D&uuml;sseldorf this first draft of the project &quot;memory 
        of space&#148; was developed. After a number of selection rounds this 
        project was chosen for the planned underground station at Jan-Wellem-Platz. 
        This is the version which was originally planned for another site: Graf-Adolf-Platz. 
        A camera monitors the space.</font></p>

      surveillance situation at the square is resolved in such a way that the 
      &quot;actors&#148;, standing at the edge of the square, can observe themselves 
      in the virtual image. On the one hand the underground station prepares the 
      arriving passengers for the square they are about to enter, on the other 
      hand the floor projection on the mezzanine level lures those visiting the 
      square down into the underground.</font></td>

        In this way the projection reproduces the image of the square one level 
        below the reality &#150; the descent into the underground could be equated 
        with entering a world of ideas in which public places could be interpreted 
        as societal constructs generated by their numerous participants. <br>

        necessary due to the path of the planned tracks being modified. <br>
