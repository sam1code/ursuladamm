      perceives a virtual sculpture that lets space-envelopes come into being 
      and vanish. This ever-changing sculpture is controlled by the occurrences 
      on Grabbeplatz. Like a naturally grown architecture this form is embedded 
      into the contours of the immediate environment of the current location of 
      the viewer. The positions of the people on Grabbeplatz as well as the position 
      of the viewer of the picture are marked with red crosses. Connecting lines 
      point from marked people approximately onto the place of the space-envelope 
      where the people influence the generated form. The installation is made 
      up of nightly projections onto the fountain wall in the passageway of K20. 
      On the roof of the Kunstsammlung D&uuml;sseldorf two infrared emitters and 
      an infrared camera are installed. The emitters make up for the missing daylight, 
      so that the camera may pick up the motions on the site. The regular light 
      is an important prerequisite to be able to deduct the motions of the people. 
      This is done by a video tracking program. It is determined where on the 
      site movement takes place by comparing the current video image with a previously 
      taken image of the empty site. The results are then sorted by &quot;blobs&quot;. 
      &quot;Blob&quot; signifies a &quot;Binary Large Object&quot; and denotes 
      a field of non-structured coordinates which moves equably. These animated 
      data-fields are passed on to a graphic- and sound program that calculates 
      the virtual sculpture from the abstracted traces. In this the motion traces 
      are interpreted. As in earlier installations such as &quot;memory space&quot; 
      (2002), &quot;trace pattern II&quot; (1998) or &quot;inoutside I&quot; (1998) 
      and &quot;inoutside II&quot; (1999), the supplied video image is visible 
      on the basis of a video texture so that the people who see this image may 
      recognize themselves in the virtual image. So it becomes clear how the virtual 
      forms, the clouds and arrows are calculated.</font></td>

      being done in the installation aims to characterise the site, whereby the 
      collecting of the different individual traces becomes essential. The early 
      installations such as &quot;trace pattern II&quot; (1998) are obviously 
      geared towards the interaction amongst the people. The behaviour of the 
      people is recorded, amplified and interpreted: Do they walk close to one 
      another? Are they walking away from each other? Are there &quot;Tracks&quot; 
      - several people walking in step? These observations become part of the 
      interpretation. In the current installation in K20 the space is represented 
      in form of one or multiple bodies. These bodies have entrances and exits, 
      openings and closures, they are being bundled from small units or melt into 
      a large whole or divide. They swell or make holes that enlarge until the 
      bodies dissolve. All these spatial elements are determined by the behaviour 
      of the people. We also map the traces of the visitors of the site according

        network, here the Kohonen map learns through self-organization. This is 
        a method of learning based on the neighbourhood relations of neurons amongst 
        each other. A network is constructed which depicts that which is on the 
        site. Beyond this the classical SOM is modified in order to solve the 
        problem, which is created when the monitored space is a limited area. 
        For at the edge different conditions for calculation apply than in the 
        middle, because the condition of a site is also rooted in its neighbourhood. 
        In the simulation of physical processes one defines the monitored area 
        simply as a torus or a sphere, whereby that, which for example disappears 
        on the right image border, re-appears on the left. This doesn't make sense 
        for a real site however, which is why we modified the procedure: in the 
        regions with too great an impulse density we let the neurons descend into 
        a second plane that disperses the neurons onto the nearest places that 
        lack neurons. Through this we created a compact cyclical energy evaluation 
        that prevents that only a cluster of the SOM would stay in the middle 
        of the space (see graphics). This would be nothing other than too high 
        of an information density that could provide no information whatsoever 
        (almost a black &quot;data hole&quot;). For me as an artist the application 
        of neural networks in very exciting, because they demand of me that I 
        restrain my artistic and visual desires for the sake of processes which 
        happen with the help of this camera eye - in reality not by the camera 
        but by the people that are the focus of the camera, so by the image of 
        the site. Since the computer-internal data processing apparatus imitates 
        the human perception apparatus, it demands of me that I be concerned about 
        the limits of perception and the possibilities and impossibilities of 
        projection of knowledge. </font></div>

      <div align="left"><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="2">As already 
        mentioned the Grabbeplatz is being reproduced in a virtual image through 
        video texture. It marks the area recorded by the tracking-program, over 
        which the calculations generate an abstract space. The nodes of the SOM 
        form trajectories in this space, nurtured by impulses that refer to speed, 
        direction and length of stay of the passers-by. So the level tracking 
        plane is expanded by another dimension. To visualize the relationships 
        of the nodes not only as points in the room but also in relation to one 
        another, we let an imagined potential energy function reign in the surrounding 
        of every which node. This function is represented as a surface in space. 
        This follows the path of every node and adapts its shape to its current 
        role in the SOM. Such surfaces are called Isosurfaces. They are used to 
        represent the homogeneity of energy states (here: potential energy states) 
        within a continuum. All points of this surface represent an equivocal 
        condition. The potential energy functions- one for each node- overlap 
        or avoid another, amplify or cancel each other out. This event visualizes 
        surfaces which comparable to soapy skin melt into or drip off each other 
        or lose themselves in infinitely minute units. In the arithmetic sum of 
        all the individual potentials lies the key to these surfaces. All points 
        in the room are determined whose potential energy function reach a certain 
        numerical value (decided upon by us). The entirety of these countless 
        points (and thereby the virtual sculpture-shape) appears as a smooth or 
        rugged, porous or compact shape whose constantly moving surface proffers 
        a new way of seeing the development of the SOM. In relation to Grabbeplatz 
        the SOM represents the time-space distortion of the site when it is not 
        seen as a continuous space-shape but as a sum of single &quot;Weltenlinien&quot; 
        (world-lines) of the passers-by, so of the paths of the individual people 
        that cross each other here by chance. The SOM also dissolves time, because 
        paths meet that were temporally offset. In this way the SOM is a memory 
        of personal times that give the Grabbeplatz its individual shape. The 
        ISO-surfaces have the function to discern the areas that are much used 
        and walked upon from those that are scarcely used. Bulges mark the frequent 
        presence of people, holes their absence. The dynamism of the ISO-surfaces 
        follows the dynamism of the accumulation of humans, who, when f. ex. they 
        reach a certain density, fall over and dissolve in turn, to avoid too 
        great of a density. </font></div>

      as a sign, that is aesthetically pleasing to me. Of course the new buildings 
      to be designed have to integrate functionally in the devised use zoning 
      plan. But these buildings should observe their surrounding during their 
      use, to determine if they are fulfilling their purpose. The question arises 
      how such a concept could be formulated if it is not only developed based 
      on the idea of one person or a committee of experts, but if it would be 
      submitted to the evaluation by the public. It is not new to claim that architecture 
      has changed with the introduction of the computer, because the methods of 
      design changed with tools or CAD-programs, etc. &quot;Blob architecture&quot; 
      denotes a young architecture that designs more than builds. Most of the 
      time biomorphous building-forms develop in 3D programs. Forms are developed 
      through for example the observation of environmental factors, that become 
      manifest. In this respect one could see the installation at Grabbeplatz 
      as a representative of this form of architecture. The goal of my projects 
      however is not to merely find a different form of buildings, which in turn 
      will only become static monuments, but to test interactive structures , 
      to see which perceptible traces create sensible structures for buildings. 
      &quot;Blob architecture&quot; will have to prove itself by the meaningfulness 
      of the data exploration to be carried out on the blobs. These methods of 
      processing imply a view of humanity that will possibly be the basis of the 
      future architecture.</font></td>

      the next project of the &quot;inoutside&quot; series the return to real 
      space will be targeted. Today a return to static form and to the sculptural 
      would be too early because we haven't advanced far enough with the evaluation 
      of the interaction to know what to build, especially as long as the building 
      materials aren't flexible yet. Also more complex interfaces are necessary 
      that could evaluate a greater spectrum of perceptible human expressions. 
      In the virtual today one is much more flexible and less damaging as long 
      as one leaves it at not building yet and checking the results in the visual 
      and acoustic through users. One can cross over to the formation of real 
      space when architecture is as changeable as the interactive system requires.</font></td>
